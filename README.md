# Automated Document Creation Application

This is a very simple application I made for fun that accepts information and automatically ingests it into word documents. This can be used for various use cases, like certificates, letters, forms or more.

## How To Use

1. Go into the doc_processing directory
2. Install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `py main.py`
4. Obtain results in the storage folder as a Zip File
5. Use this tool for yourself by editing the codes in `main.py` and changing `Template.docx`. Make sure to edit the data in `data.csv` as well

## Technologies

- Python

## Future Improvements

- Port it onto the cloud with AWS or Azure
- Making it so that the app can be easily used by general public through dynamic creation and a user interface
